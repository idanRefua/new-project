              Reflexology is a holistic method of diagnosis and treatment that
              uses massage and pressure on the feet and hands. The word
              reflexology is derived from the term reflex, return, because it is
              based on processes of response to stimulation. There is evidence
              of the use of reflexology already in ancient times, for example,
              in wall paintings in the pyramids in Egypt, as well as in China,
              India and Indian tribes in America. Modern reflexology was
              developed by Eunice Hingham in the 1940s and it was popularized in
              the United States and from there it moved around the world. In the
              feet there is a representation of the whole body. By pressing on
              the reflex points, you can influence the body's organs and
              systems. Hence the second meaning of the word reflexology,
              reflection, reflection of the body in the feet. The existing
              reflection, the right foot represents the right part of the body,
              the left foot represents the left part of the body, when There is
